Daily copies of CraftIt, the world's best Minecraft server. (craftitserver.com)

Little disclamer: This is the ENTIRE server, including Dynmap. You can run an entire server from this, therefore the filesize may increase as more players join the server. 
Please be wary of the filesize. (Currently about 200MB)

Includes:
Full Dynmap
World Files
Ubuntu Startup Script (s.sh)
Plugins

How to run this server (on Ubuntu):
Pull the latest source code from our git repo
Make the startup script runnable: chmod +x s.sh
Start the server: ./start.sh
Enjoy! Run git pull to combine changes on the server with your own server.

All world files are copyrighted by SSD, and can be used for personal use, however making a direct copy, using the name CraftIt, using spawn/user's houses/structures in your own
server, or using databases for malicious purposes is not ok and legal charges will be filed and pressed.
